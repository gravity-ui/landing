**List** — a universal list component that serves as a container with data rows organized into a single vertical column. The component sorts its child list-item elements, supports multiple sizes, and enables keyboard selection control and filtering.

**List-item**

All list items (List-item) support rendering in 4 sizes: S, M, L, XL. The sizes and paddings correspond to the library items with which the component interacts, such as select, input, and button, which support similar size variables.

**List**

By default, the width of the List component is dynamic and is calculated based on the width of the longest item on the list. The width can be set to a fixed value or inherit the width of the object that triggered the display of the list (select, input).

**Customizable height for the main container of the list**

The height of list items or a function that returns the height value can be dynamically set or specified with an exact value in pixels (px). If the list items exceed the maximum height, a scroll bar appears.  The height can be set manually or adjusted dynamically.

**Call triggers**

By default, the list component is triggered by interactions with other page elements such as select, label, and button, and serves as a suggestion feature for the Input component.

**Virtualization**

When the virtualization flag is enabled, the browser renders only a subset of rows at a time, significantly reducing the time required to re-render components. With this method, also known as "infinite loading," new items are added to the list as the user scrolls down to a specific threshold item (trigger).
