Gravity-UI is a collection of libraries and components for building functional user interfaces. The design system supports multiple themes: **light**, **dark**, and **high-contrast** variations of each. The visual style of the components in every theme can be easily customized.

**Color**

The design system consists of four themes based on a two-layer color model. The theming engine supports versatile color customization and brand identities with different sets of requirements.

**Typography**

The typography system consists of typesetting styles, display fonts, and code (monospace font). You can use the default fonts or create your own.

**Control corner radius**

The corner radius is a small yet important part of the visual style. To make it easier to work with it, we developed a set of radius variables. These variables are used by different controls. To adjust the radius of the controls, simply change the values of the variables.

**Creating and using a theme**

Whatever the brand and visual language, it all comes down to a set of constants that you should be able to easily edit and use in both your code and Figma's library.
