**Positioning**

By default, the dropdown menu appears beneath the element that invokes it, with the menu icon in the right corner. If the interface does not support a drop-down list beneath the switch icon, the list expands above the icon.

# Recommendations

Dropdown menus are used when there are at least two options to choose from.The optimal number of options is between 5 and 10.

When arranging menu elements, ensure a logical order by placing the most frequently used and popular options at the top.Try out different menu items and refine them as needed.
