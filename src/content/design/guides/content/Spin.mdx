Is an indicator that shows the progress of a task, such as loading, uploading data, processing, and so on, until the interface is completely ready for user interaction. The indicator does not show measurable progress but rather that the process has not yet been completed and is still ongoing.

### Application

Used in situations when the Loader component is not applicable. For example, when the indicator container is smaller or equal in size, so the loader disrupts the visual balance.

### Sizes

The component's size is adjusted to match the font height of the text next to it, the container, or other adjacent elements.
