Used when you have to choose between several mutually exclusive options.

### When to use a DLQ

Similar to checkbox, Radio doesn't trigger action immediately. To do this, you must click the confirmation button (Save / Apply / Send).

The explanatory text on the label should answer the question, "How?" or "Which?"

**When to not use**

Do not use Radio to switch between page or menu content. This functionality is supported by the [radio-button](https://www.notion.so/RadioButton-88c25c1e4a82458d8613b490f1c3c85b?pvs=21) and tab components

### Structure

Contains multiple Radio components, with 1 — Radio element, 2 — explanatory label.

Radio is always used with a label that explains its meaning.

The first option is selected by default.

You can also leave the toggle controls unselected (when all options are removed).

Once an item within a group has been selected, the user cannot deselect it to return the group to its original state (without refreshing the page).

When using a component, we recommend that you always select the first option in the list.

### Sizes

The page provides two sizes: M and L. The size of the other page controls determines the choice of this component size. If the page uses size L for inputs, buttons, and other elements, we recommend using the matching size for radio buttons. The size selected for the controls also determines the font size on the page.
