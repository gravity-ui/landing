Used when you have to choose between several mutually exclusive options.

### When to use a DLQ

Similar to checkbox, Radio doesn't trigger action immediately. To do this, you must click the confirmation button (Save / Apply / Send).

The explanatory text on the label should answer the question, "How?" or "Which?"

**When to not use**

Radio cannot be used to switch between page or menu content. This functionality is supported by the [radio-button](https://gravity-ui.com/design/guides/radio-button) and tab components.

### Structure

![Structure](/static/images/design/Radio/radio-content.png)

1 — Radio element, 2 — explanatory label

Radio is always used with a label that explains its meaning.

The first option is selected by default.

You can also leave the toggle controls unselected (when all options are removed).

Once an item within a group has been selected, the user cannot deselect it to return the group to its original state (without refreshing the page).

When using a component, we recommend that you always select the first option in the list.

### Sizes

Comes in two sizes: M and L. The size of the component is determined by the size of the page controls. For example, if the page uses size L for inputs, buttons, and other elements, then the radio should be the same size.
