The component library is available in Figma Community. To use it we recommend publishing in

1. Open the link
2. Click `Open in Figma`
3. If you’ve been invited to several organisations, select where you want to have the library copied to
4. Move the library from your drafts to your project adjust the styles you want to and publish it
5. Add the library to a desired file using the `Team Library` interface or make it a default library for all the Team Files in the Admin Pane. The first time you publish it, Figma might think for a while assembling all the styles and components.
