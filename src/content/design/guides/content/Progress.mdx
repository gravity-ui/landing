This is a component for embedding a horizontal bar chart into various interfaces. It can show data distribution, share, or progress.

## Use cases

âœ…Â **When to use**
Use it when you need to show the level of completion or filling of an entity such as free space on the disk, the number of completed tasks, etc.

ðŸš«**When not to use**
When you need to show a single value without comparison. For example, you can use Progress to show 15/60, but not 15 alone.

## Structure

## Sizes

![Sizes](/static/images/design/Progress/progress-0002.png)

1. **M** is the only size that has text. Use in sections with a large amount of space, on pages where the progress indicator is the key element.
2. **S** is used in tables, cards, and separately where progress is not the only key component on the page
3. **XS** is used in narrow places, where you need to keep your content compact.

## Themes

![Themes](/static/images/design/Progress/progress-0003.png)

**Default** is most often used for neutral cases, when you do not need to draw extra attention to progress, for instance, when the page includes more important elements

**Info** is also used for neutral cases, where you need to put more emphasis on progress, or to show that the operation is in progress

**Success** is used for successfully completed processes or to indicate that the system is running without issues

**Warning** is used in unusual situations to warn the user about something, for example, to draw user attention to an impending issue.

**Danger**is used to attract maximum attention, when an error has occurred, and the user needs to take actions to resolve the problem: disk space has run out, system has failed, etc.

**Misc** is used in neutral cases, when you do not want to use Default.

## Scope

1. **Changing the color depending on the progress value**. You can configure this component to change color depending on the progress value, for example, the standard indication is blue (info), and 100% is green (success).

2. **Loading animation. Use** it to show real-time progress to the user, for example, when uploading files from a computer.

3. **Custom colors.** You can use your set of Progress colors when all other options do not fit: use a custom color and combine multiple colors.
