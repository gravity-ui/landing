## Description

Link - is a part of the text, that, when clicked, takes the user to another part of the page, another page inside the service, or to a page of another external service.

The main difference from the [Button](/components/uikit/button) is the navigation function. Links more often lead to other pages or open new browser tabs.

## Appearance

There can be three types: `normal`(the usual blue), `primary`(black), `secondary`(gray). it is controlled by the view property.

### Normal

The most familiar and well-established pattern of use for users. It is used to visually highlight an element inside a text, table, and as part of navigation. It is used to navigate to pages inside the service and to external sources, including documentation. Also, they are used on error pages and zero states.

```
<Link view="normal" href="#">
    Link
</Link>
```

<ExampleBlock>
    <Link view="normal" href="#">
        Link
    </Link>
</ExampleBlock>

### Primary

They are used when it is natively clear to the user that it is possible to interact with an element, but visually using blue links will overload the interface and disrupt the balance of accents on the page.

```
<Link view="primary" href="#">
    Link
</Link>
```

<ExampleBlock>
    <Link view="primary" href="#">
        Link
    </Link>
</ExampleBlock>

### Secondary

Like primary links, they are used when it is natively clear to the user that an element can be interacted with, and the need to navigate through them is secondary and affects a small number of scenarios. The main task is not to argue with the accents on the page. It is more often used in bread crumbs or when displaying secondary attributes.

```
<Link view="secondary" href="#">
    Link
</Link>
```

<ExampleBlock>
    <Link view="secondary" href="#">
        Link
    </Link>
</ExampleBlock>

## Href

`href` property is optional. If it is absent, then Link wil act like Button.

```
<Link href="#">Link with href</Link>
<Link>Link without href</Link>
```

<ExampleBlock>
    <Link href="#">Link with href</Link>
    <Link>Link without href</Link>
</ExampleBlock>

## Usage

Ð¡an be used as an independent text element, or as part of the text

```
<Text>
    <Link>what roles are active in the service</Link>
</Text>
<Text>
    Currently, this role can only be assigned to a <Link>folder</Link> or <Link>cloud</Link>
</Text>
```

<ExampleBlock>
    <Text>
        <Link>what roles are active in the service</Link>
    </Text>
    <Text>
        Currently, this role can only be assigned to a <Link>folder</Link> or <Link>cloud</Link>
    </Text>
