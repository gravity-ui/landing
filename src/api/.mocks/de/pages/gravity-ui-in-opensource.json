In this article, I’d like to share some news: we’ve open-sourced our design system and component library [Gravity\\_UI](https://github.com/gravity-ui){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}. \\n\\nWith the Gravity\\_UI component library, you can build modern interfaces. It includes:\\n\\n  * a set of basic React components;\\n  * a landing page builder library;\\n  * [detailed guides](https://gravity-ui.com/design){target=\\\"_blank\\\"} on using the components;\\n  * a library in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1271150067798118027/Gravity-UI-Design-System-(Beta)){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}; \\n  * a set of ready-made icons with nearly 600 options;\\n  * ChartKit — a data visualization package;\\n  * Yagr — high-performance chart rendering based on uPlot;\\n  * I18n — a UI localization package\\n  * and more than [25 useful libraries](https://gravity-ui.com/libraries){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\n\"\n      - type: blog-media-block\n        column: left\n        resetPaddings: true\n        text: ''\n        image:\n          src: >-\n            https://storage.yandexcloud.net/cloud-www-assets/blog-assets/ru/posts/2025/12/gravity-ui-in-opensource/pic0.png\n        fullscreen: true\n      - type: blog-yfm-block\n        column: left\n        resetPaddings: true\n        text: \"\\nBelow the cut is a story about why we created Gravity\\_UI, how we use it, what the features and advantages of our approach are, and how we plan to evolve it further. Also: how to configure different color schemes in your projects and why we have four themes instead of the usual two.\\n\\n{% cut \\\"Why we created Gravity\\_UI\\\" %}\\n\\nInitially, the UIKit library was an internal product to speed up the team’s work. As the number of new services grew, we set a goal: to build a unified UX across our products. It was important to use the same user behavior patterns across services so that users would perceive the entire platform as a single whole.\\n\\nAn additional goal for the design team was to create tools so that developers could build a new service without involving designers.\\n\\nRelatively recently, platforms and services using our design system started going open source: [YTsaurus](https://ytsaurus.tech/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}, [YDB](https://ydb.tech/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}, [DataLens](https://datalens.tech/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}, [Diplodoc](https://diplodoc.com/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}. Many users spoke positively about them and helped improve the code together with the developers. Inspired by their example, we came up with the idea to release Gravity\\_UI to the public as well, because we saw how useful the library could be for many services — not only inside Yandex.\\n\\n{% endcut %}\\n\"\n      - type: blog-yfm-block\n        column: left\n        resetPaddings: true\n        text: \"\\n## What are the features of Gravity\\_UI{#peculiarities}\\n\\n### Based on real-world experience\\n\\nOne of the distinguishing features of our design system is that it evolves based on the needs of our users — most of whom are developers. Moreover, our designers are closely tied to the products they work on. Each designer has several services with their own usage scenarios. After a solution has been tested in their services, the product designer rolls it out to other services to make sure it works and helps developers. \\n\\nFor example, the side navigation component initially evolved with only a logo and menu items. Later, for convenience, we added an item with all services and a search feature. And when we got a service where there was a need to create a new entity right from the side menu, we added a separate plus button. Next came menu sections with dividers for complex services with lots of menu items, as well as an “Other items” button.\\n\"\n      - type: blog-media-block\n        column: left\n        resetPaddings: true\n        paddingBottom: s\n        text: >-\n          The Navigation component — you can configure it as a simple version or\n          as a fully loaded one\n        image:\n          src: >-\n            https://storage.yandexcloud.net/cloud-www-assets/blog-assets/ru/posts/2025/12/gravity-ui-in-opensource/pic1.png\n        fullscreen: true\n      - type: blog-yfm-block\n        column: left\n        resetPaddings: true\n        text: \"\\n### Flexible variability\\n\\nMany Gravity\\_UI components can be configured for different scenarios.

But if your case has only a few results, you can use a compact mode or even hide the numbers and show only arrows. \\n\"\n      - type: blog-media-block\n        column: left\n        resetPaddings: true\n        paddingBottom: s\n        text: Example of displaying different pagination variants\n        image:\n          src: >-\n            https://storage.yandexcloud.net/cloud-www-assets/blog-assets/ru/posts/2025/12/gravity-ui-in-opensource/pic2.png\n        fullscreen: true\n      - type: blog-yfm-block\n        column: left\n        resetPaddings: true\n        text: \"\\n### Broad range of applications\\n\\nWith Gravity\\_UI, you can build both a simple admin interface and a complex dashboard with charts.

In addition to\n          feedback from our developer community, we receive suggestions from\n          more than 100 services that already use our design system. \n\n\n          Here’s an example. Initially, we had two themes — dark and light. But\n          we started receiving feedback from teams that broadcast the interface\n          to TVs for viewing charts or during stand-ups. The issue is that the\n          interface is hard to see on a TV. A similar problem also occurs for\n          users with old or low-quality monitors.\n\n\n          As a result, we developed increased contrast for each theme. It\n          increases the brightness of dark and light colors as well as semantic\n          colors. This is configured via CSS styles and controlled in user\n          settings.\n      - type: blog-media-block\n        column: left\n        resetPaddings: true\n        text: \"Example of the Yandex Tracker interface, also built with Gravity\\_UI components, with the option to enable increased contrast\"\n        image:\n          src: >-\n            https://storage.yandexcloud.net/cloud-www-assets/blog-assets/ru/posts/2025/12/gravity-ui-in-opensource/pic5.png\n        fullscreen: true\n      - type: blog-yfm-block\n        column: left\n        resetPaddings: true\n        text: >\n\n          By the way, now you can contribute too.

I’ll start with the ability to customize the design system to match your brand. For example, when YDB went open source, we faced the task of keeping a unified design system while also making it distinctive for different brands. To do this, we created a separate group of CSS variables. It includes brand colors, fonts, and border radii. In code, it looks like a small block:\\n\\n```json          \\n.g-root {\\n    --g-font-family-sans: 'Inter', sans-serif;\\n\\n    --g-text-header-font-weight: 600;\\n    --g-text-subheader-font-weight: 600;\\n    --g-text-display-font-weight: 600;\\n    --g-text-accent-font-weight: 600;\\n\\n    --g-color-base-brand: rgb(117, 155, 255);\\n    --g-color-base-brand-hover: rgb(99, 143, 255);\\n    --g-color-base-selection: rgba(82, 130, 255, 0.05);\\n    --g-color-base-selection-hover: rgba(82, 130, 255, 0.1);\\n    --g-color-line-brand: rgb(117, 155, 255);\\n    --g-color-text-brand: rgb(117, 155, 255);\\n    --g-color-text-brand-contrast: rgb(255, 255 ,255);\\n    --g-color-text-link: rgb(117, 155, 255);\\n    --g-color-text-link-hover: rgb(82, 130, 255);\\n\\n    --g-border-radius-xs: 3px;\\n    --g-border-radius-s: 5px;\\n    --g-border-radius-m: 6px;\\n    --g-border-radius-l: 8px;\\n    --g-border-radius-xl: 10px;\\n    --g-border-radius-2xl: 16px;\\n}\\n```\\n\\nIn this group, you can replace the font, the color of accent buttons, and the rounding radii. This way, you can use a single design system for different brands while preserving each brand’s identity. If this option doesn’t work for you, you can create your own color scheme. There’s a detailed guide in the [documentation](https://preview.gravity-ui.com/uikit/?path=/docs/branding-overview--docs#additional-customization){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\n\"\n      - type: blog-media-block\n        column: left\n        resetPaddings: true\n        text: Example interfaces with different brand variables\n        image:\n          src: >-\n            https://storage.yandexcloud.net/cloud-www-assets/blog-assets/ru/posts/2025/12/gravity-ui-in-opensource/pic6.png\n        fullscreen: true\n      - type: blog-yfm-block\n        column: left\n        resetPaddings: true\n        text: >\n\n          It’s worth noting that changing brand colors won’t affect the core\n          interface. This is especially important for elements that use semantic\n          colors: for example, red will still mean an error, and green will\n          still mean success.\n\n\n          ### Components in Figma\n\n\n          For convenience, our design team prepared and uploaded all component\n          states to\n          [Figma](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1271150067798118027){target=\"_blank\"}.\n          If you want, you can make a copy of the library and try building an\n          interface directly in the tool.\n\n\n          With the latest update, the library no longer duplicates all four\n          themes. By default, you work in the light theme, but in the Layer\n          section you can switch any element — or the whole page — to another\n          theme. \n      - type: blog-media-block\n        column: left\n        resetPaddings: true\n        text: How to preview an element in different themes\n        image:\n          src: >-\n            https://storage.yandexcloud.net/cloud-www-assets/blog-assets/ru/posts/2025/12/gravity-ui-in-opensource/pic7.png\n        fullscreen: true\n      - type: blog-yfm-block\n        column: left\n        resetPaddings: true\n        text: >\n\n          All library elements are presented on the Overview page. Here you can\n          find the component you need and go to the page with all its states. In\n          addition, each component has a usage example. \n      - type: blog-media-block\n        column: left\n        resetPaddings: true\n        paddingBottom: s\n        text: \"A page with all Gravity\\_UI elements\"\n        image:\n          src: >-\n            https://storage.yandexcloud.net/cloud-www-assets/blog-assets/ru/posts/2025/12/gravity-ui-in-opensource/pic8.png\n        fullscreen: true\n      - type: blog-yfm-block\n        column: left\n        resetPaddings: true\n        text: >\n\n          ### Nearly 600 icons\n\n          Icons are an essential part of design and usability. They help\n          organize and structure content, set accents, and improve how\n          information is perceived. At first glance, creating an icon pack\n          doesn’t seem too hard. But we faced a challenge when creating icons\n          for complex metaphors such as virtual machines, databases, and various\n          chart types.\n      - type: blog-media-block\n        column: left\n        resetPaddings: true\n        text: We currently have 594 icons, but there will be more soon\n        image:\n          src: >-\n            https://storage.yandexcloud.net/cloud-www-assets/blog-assets/ru/posts/2025/12/gravity-ui-in-opensource/pic9.png\n        fullscreen: true\n      - type: blog-media-block\n        column: left\n        resetPaddings: true\n        text: >-\n          Developing icons for a WYSIWYG content editor was also a special\n          challenge — it’s being integrated in various places for text\n          formatting\n        image:\n          src: >-\n            https://storage.yandexcloud.net/cloud-www-assets/blog-assets/ru/posts/2025/12/gravity-ui-in-opensource/pic10.png\n        fullscreen: true\n      - type: blog-yfm-block\n        column: left\n        resetPaddings: true\n        text: >\n\n          To make icon search more convenient, we used a special naming system.\n          Now you can find the same icon by typing different names. For example,\n          to find an arrow-like icon, you can type any of these words: arrow,\n          enter, move, login.\n      - type: blog-media-block\n        column: left\n        resetPaddings: true\n        paddingBottom: s\n        text: >-\n          All icons are available on a [separate\n          page](https://gravity-ui.com/icons).

We\n          aimed to make this process simple, without the need to contact a\n          designer for every single element. At the moment, we already have five\n          examples of internal services that were fully built by developers\n          using only the guides.\n\n\n          Of course, you can’t solve this task with developers’ hands alone: in\n          any case, there are complex scenarios that require the attention of a\n          UX/UI specialist. Nevertheless, we managed to remove a significant\n          portion of the load from our designers.\n\n\n          In the guides, the design team described the components and provided\n          recommendations on how to use them, showing examples of the right and\n          wrong approach. You can view them on [this\n          page](https://gravity-ui.com/components/uikit/alert){target=\"_blank\"}.\n      - type: blog-media-block\n        column: left\n        resetPaddings: true\n        text: ''\n        image:\n          src: >-\n            https://storage.yandexcloud.net/cloud-www-assets/blog-assets/ru/posts/2025/12/gravity-ui-in-opensource/pic12.png\n        fullscreen: true\n      - type: blog-yfm-block\n        column: left\n        resetPaddings: true\n        text: \"\\n## How to use Gravity\\_UI{#use}\\n\\nAll you need to do is run the command in the terminal:\\n\\n```\\ngit clone git@github.com:gravity-ui/uikit-example-cra.git my-project && cd my-project\\nnpm i \\nnpm run start\\n```\\n\\nMore detailed instructions are available on the repository’s main page on [GitHub](https://github.com/gravity-ui/uikit){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}.\\n\\nYou can browse all Gravity\\_UI components in [UIkit](https://preview.gravity-ui.com/uikit/){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}, and connect the library you need for your use case in [Libraries](https://gravity-ui.com/libraries){target=\\\"_blank\\\"}. \\n\\n--------\\n\\nTo sum it up, I’d like to emphasize once again: Gravity\\_UI is a design system that grew out of the real experience of our users, developers’ needs, and designers’ expertise. This makes it practical and effective. And now anyone can use it for free.\\n\\nWe strive to make the project even better by taking into account our users’ needs and feedback. Visit us on GitHub, submit PRs, leave comments in Figma, and share examples of how you use it.\\n\"\n  - type: blog-layout-block\n    resetPaddings: true\n    fullWidth: false\n    children:\n      - type: blog-meta-block\n        column: left\n        resetPaddings: true\n  - type: blog-suggest-block\n    resetPaddings: true\n",
